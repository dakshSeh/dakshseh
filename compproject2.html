   <b> Corruption</b><br>
    By François Melese<br><br>
    
    In the world’s worst offending countries, corrupt government officials steal public money and collude with businesses to sell laws, rules, regulations, and government contracts. The World Bank reports that “higher levels of corruption are associated with lower per capita income” (World Bank 2001, p. 105). Corruption breeds poverty, and poverty kills. In other words, corruption kills.<br><br>
    
    How so? Corruption sabotages economies and undermines political institutions. Its most devastating impact is on investment. By discouraging investment, corruption crushes economic growth and slashes per capita incomes. According to Mauro (1995), for example, if Bangladesh had cut corruption over the period 1960–1985 to the level of one of the world’s cleanest countries (Singapore), it would have increased its growth rate by 1.8 percentage points per year. By 1985, its per capita income would have been more than 50 percent higher. Low-per-capita-income countries suffer higher infant mortality—54 deaths per 1,000 live births in Bangladesh versus 3 per 1,000 in Singapore—and lower average life expectancies—fifty-nine years versus eighty years (U.S. Census Bureau 2000.) Another insidious way in which corruption kills is that it skews public spending away from operating budgets such as health care and toward capital budgets—military spending, for example, where bribes are easier to extract (Klitgaard 1988; Mauro 1996; Tanzi and Davoodi 1997).<br><br>
    
    Corruption hurts investment in at least three ways. First, it increases the cost of doing business, which then raises the threshold revenues required for businesses to break even. Second, it causes producers, on the margin, to bribe officials rather than invest in cost-saving technology or new products. Third, if public funds end up in the pockets of government officials, taxes will be higher and public investment lower, hurting economic growth.<br><br>

    <b> Corrupt histories</b><br>
    by Pieter Wagenaar<br><br>

    Corruption is an elusive concept, especially to historians. ‘How should it be defined?’, is the question bedeviling most scholars trying to study the phenomenon. Heidenheimer’s work might be of help. After all, this scholar has developed a categorization of several types of corruption definitions. Corruption can be defined as breaking the rules pertaining to a certain office, it can be defined economically, and it can be defined as acting against general interest. Scott has drawn up a slightly different categorization: corruption is acting against the laws pertaining to it, or acting against what the public opinion deems integrity, or, again, acting against general interest.<br><br>

Yet, both authors also point out what the drawbacks of these definitions are. If we define corruption as breaking the rules pertaining to a certain office, we use a modern, ‘Weberian’ definition of the phenomenon. Yet, Weberian bureaucracies hardly existed in the past, and are still lacking in many countries. What is more, breaking the rules can also be a practical necessity. All public functionaries do it, every now and then, without necessarily being corrupt. If we define corruption economically, we might be using a modern public-private dichotomy alien to past societies, and ‘general interest definitions’ of corruption fall short for the simple reason that there is no such thing as ‘general interest’. There are only private interests claiming to be general interest. The same can be said about the public opinion. Societal groups differ hugely in their views on corruption, and these views are highly changeable. Legal definitions of corruption are probably the trickiest. Obviously, we cannot apply our laws to past societies, but looking to contemporary law for definitions of corruptions is just as dangerous. As it happens, law often follows practice, but at a distance, and also reflects the norms and values of only a part of society. Finally, not everything that is legal is considered to be ethical.<br><br>

Not long ago Michael Johnston has found a way out of these difficulties. He advocates a “neo-classical” approach to corruption: scholars should study the way the concept corruption is constructed, to find out how administrative and societal values have been fought over and have changed over time. Corruption scandals are often the moments when such struggles become visible, and when their outcomes are consolidated2. Following Johnston, we should not start with corruption definitions, we should investigate how corruption is defined and redefined.<br><br>

    <b>Corruption in India</b><br>
    by Sandip Sukhtankar and Milan Vaishnav<br><br>

    Corruption has become an increasingly salient issue in India today, spawning both
enormous interest from the media as well as a large amount of academic research. Yet there is a
large gap between what has captured the media’s attention, the policy options under
discussion, and the actual evidence base drawn from empirical research on corruption. We
attempt to bridge this gap, directly addressing the particular challenges that corruption in India
poses. Academic evidence supports the popular perception that corruption is widespread and
endemic. However, we find that the costs of day-to-day corruption are just as large, if not
larger, than those of the “scams” that dominate headlines. Further, we find that there is very
little evidence to support the idea that greater transparency, information, and community based
efforts have a significant impact on reducing corruption on their own. This is also true for some
technological interventions, although those interventions – like direct benefit transfers – that
bypass middlemen and corrupt officials have a much greater scope for success, as do
interventions that transfer bargaining power to citizens and beneficiaries. We find much to
commend in the sensible and wide-ranging legislative agenda to combat corruption, including
the Right to Service and Public Procurement bills. However, what is most important for
combating corruption is not the law on paper but the implementation of the law; the binding
constraint, as always, is the government’s desire and ability to punish corrupt officials and
politicians.<br><br>

    <b>Overview of corruption and anti-
        corruption developments in India</b><br>
        by Kaunain Rahman<br><br>

        Once regarded as the world's largest democracy, the success of India's democratic performance
stands at a crossroads with increasing restrictions on fundamental freedoms and a crackdown on
those speaking against the government. Corruption remains an endemic problem that affects
various areas in the public and private sectors, including institutions such as the police and
judiciary, while affecting all levels of governance. The vast majority of human rights abuses in the
country are enabled via a corrupt environment. The government has crippled critical law
enforcement and accountability institutions at the central and the state level by the twin devices
of amending the anti-corruption laws to curb their effectiveness, functional autonomy and
politicising the appointments to human rights commissions, information commissions and anti-
corruption agencies like Lokpal and Lokayuktas. Systemic corruption has resulted in the curbing
of voices of dissent raised by anti-corruption campaigners, transparency and accountability
advocates and human rights activists. Journalists reporting corruption are particularly at risk in an
increasingly curtailed civic space.<br><br>
